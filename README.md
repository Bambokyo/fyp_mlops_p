### Pose Quest: Efficient pose retrieval from large motion Databases
Human Pose Estimation (HPE) in computer vision has gained prominence in applications like animation, gaming, and virtual reality. The challenge arises from managing high-dimensional data and non-Euclidean metrics in vast motion databases. This paper addresses the problem of compromised efficiency and speed in existing pose retrieval systems due to the exponential growth of visual data. The research problem lies in the need for innovative solutions to ensure precise and timely access to pose data in a complex data landscape. We aim to develop enhanced, adaptive methodologies for efficient and accurate pose retrieval, bridging the gap between abundant yet intricate visual data and the requirements of professionals and industries relying on HPE. This work redefines the HPE landscape by offering agile solutions to navigate this evolving challenge.
